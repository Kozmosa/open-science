# Deployment Architecture & Operations

Production and staging deployment topology, rebuild procedures, monitoring,
observability stack, and operational safety. Read this when deploying,
debugging production issues, modifying Docker/deploy configurations, or
setting up monitoring.

**Safety rule** (from AGENTS.md): Do NOT operate production deployment
containers unless the user explicitly asks you to.

## Production Deployment Architecture (CPU-only)

The current production environment uses **CPU-only Docker Compose** with host networking:

```bash
# Deploy command (from repo root)
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.cpu.yml up -d --build
```

**Architecture overview:**

| Service | Image | Listen | Role |
|---------|-------|--------|------|
| `ainrf` | `deploy/Dockerfile` (built) | `127.0.0.1:18000` | FastAPI backend |
| `nginx` | `nginx:1.27-alpine` | `0.0.0.0:8192` | Reverse proxy + frontend static |
| `prometheus` | `prom/prometheus:v3.3.1` | `127.0.0.1:9091` | Metrics collection |
| `grafana` | `grafana/grafana:11.6.1` | `127.0.0.1:3000` | Monitoring dashboard |

- All services use `network_mode: host` (no Docker NAT).
- External access: `http://<host>:8192` → nginx → backend on 18000.
- Frontend static files are served from `frontend/dist/production` (host-mounted, read-only).
- Backend runs as `ainrf` user (uid=1000) after privilege drop by entrypoint.
- Config: `deploy/config/nginx-host.conf` for nginx, `deploy/docker-compose.cpu.yml` for service layout.

### Monitoring & Alerting (production default)

The CPU-only deployment includes Prometheus + Grafana with pre-configured dashboards and alert rules:

- **Grafana dashboard**: `http://<host>:8192/grafana` — pre-provisioned `ainrf-overview` dashboard shows HTTP request rates, auth events, SSH connections, terminal exec denials, and DB query latency. Auth proxy is enabled (login via AINRF session).
- **Prometheus**: scrapes `http://localhost:18000/metrics` every 15s; alert rules in `deploy/examples/prometheus-rules.example.yml` cover login failure rate, account lockouts, terminal exec denials, sensitive file access, high request/error rate. Copy to `deploy/config/prometheus/rules/ainrf.yml` and adjust thresholds.
- **Alert routing**: Prometheus evaluates rules; to receive notifications, configure Alertmanager or Grafana alert channels (not included by default — add a Grafana contact point for email/Slack/webhook).

### LLM Observability (optional overlay)

An independent Litefuse (Langfuse fork) stack provides trace-level LLM observability — token usage per call, prompt/completion logging, latency breakdown, cost tracking:

```bash
# Layer the observability stack on top of the base deployment
docker compose -f docker-compose.cpu.yml -f docker-compose.observability.yml up -d
```

- **Litefuse UI**: `http://<host>:13000` — after first start, create admin account and generate API keys.
- **Configuration**: set `AINRF_OBSERVABILITY_ENABLED=true` plus `AINRF_OBSERVABILITY_SECRET_KEY` / `PUBLIC_KEY` / `BASE_URL` in `.env`, then restart the ainrf service. See `deploy/docker-compose.observability.yml` header for full secret generation instructions.
- **Integration points**: `AgenticResearcherService` wraps each task lifecycle as a trace with per-turn generation spans; `LiteratureScheduler` wraps each subscription fetch. Both coexist with existing SQLite token tracking (dual-write).
- **Graceful degradation**: when Litefuse is disabled or unreachable, `SafeReporter` wraps all calls in try/except — observability failures never affect the main application.

| Observability Stack | Service | Port | What it shows |
|---------------------|---------|------|---------------|
| **Grafana** | Infrastructure + API metrics | `:8192/grafana` | HTTP rates, auth events, SSH, DB latency |
| **Prometheus** | Time-series metrics + queries | `:8192/prometheus` | Query builder, scrape targets, rules |
| **Litefuse** | LLM call traces | `:8192/litefuse/` | Per-call tokens, prompts, latency, cost |

### Named Docker Volumes (persistent data)

| Volume | Mount point | Content |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `ainrf-state` | `/opt/ainrf/state` | SQLite databases, config, logs |
| `ainrf-workspaces` | `/opt/ainrf/.ainrf_workspaces` | User workspaces |
| `ainrf-tenants` | `/home/ainrf_tenants` | Tenant home directories |

### Key Configuration (set in `.env`)

- `AINRF_JWT_SECRET` — JWT signing key (required)
- `AINRF_API_KEY_HASHES` — SHA-256 hashes of API keys (required)
- `AINRF_PUBLIC_REGISTRATION_ENABLED` — defaults to `false`
- Agent tool keys: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `CODEX_API_KEY`, etc.

### Known Operational Issues

- **sshd session proliferation**: Each terminal health-check spawns an SSH session pair (root priv + ainrf child). These accumulate over the container lifetime. Container restart is the current cleanup path.

## Rebuild & Redeploy

```bash
# Backend-only changes — use the wrapper so the host git commit is stamped
# into the image (otherwise the backend reports "Unavailable" for its version).
bash deploy/redeploy-backend.sh

# Frontend-only changes — rebuilds the target-specific host bundle, then restarts nginx.
bash deploy/redeploy-frontend.sh

# Staging targets (same scripts, different target):
bash deploy/redeploy-backend.sh --target staging
bash deploy/redeploy-frontend.sh --target staging

# Bare fallback (no commit stamping; backend version shows "Unavailable"):
# docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.cpu.yml up -d --build ainrf
```

**Version provenance is split**: the backend bakes its OWN commit into
`/opt/ainrf/backend-build-info.json` (via `redeploy-backend.sh` build-args),
and the frontend ships its OWN target-specific `build-info.json` (built on the
host). Because the two build at different times, they may differ — the
Settings page shows both and flags a mismatch.

**Why host build is required**: nginx serves frontend from a **host-mounted** target directory, not from the container's built-in `/opt/ainrf/frontend/dist`. Production uses `frontend/dist/production`, staging uses `frontend/dist/staging`, and GPU deployment uses `frontend/dist/gpu`; rebuilding one environment therefore cannot replace another environment's assets. Verify the `index-*.js` hash in the target directory matches what the browser requests.

Deployment wrappers explicitly clear `VITE_OPENSCIENCE_API_KEY` and
`VITE_AINRF_API_KEY` while building. Local WebUI credentials belong only to
the Vite proxy process and must never be embedded into a deployed browser
bundle through a lingering `.env.local` file.

## First-Time Admin Password

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.cpu.yml exec ainrf cat /opt/ainrf/state/admin_initial_password.txt
```

## Security & Configuration Tips

Do not commit secrets, SSH keys, or generated artifacts. Keep runtime state under `.ainrf/` out of version control. Prefer `uv run` over manual venv management so local execution matches the project lockfile.
